# Advancing AI

>AI/Machine learning is an approach to problem solving which holds much potential due to its unique approaches 

## Breaking down current capabilities of AI

**- Personalisation and Profilling**
Targeting preferences through building understandings on individuals For example, *Spotify* suggesting music you may like aswell as Netflix & Amazon suggesting films or products you may be interested in. 
<br />
<br />
**- Predictions**
<br />Systems that predict what will happen in the future (drawing from historical data to predict actions. For example, to predict if a client will close an account). Used to predict stocks, currency exchanges, prices, potential customers.
<br />
<br />
**- Natural Language**
<br />Natural language processing, referring to the capability of computers and artificial intelligence's ability to understand human language from the form of voice notes and text etc. These systems also try to further understand one's emotions behind the messages. The most famous examples are Siri and google assistant as voice-activated/responding systems. Another example is chatbots on websites, more often than not, you're talking to a system instead of an employee.
<br />
<br />
**- Pattern Recognition and Anomaly Detection**
<br />Pattern recognition systems look for consistent patterns to establish a state of normal. This can be used to create suggestions for the user, for example, if you're in the middle of browsing, a usefule or accurate topic of search could be suggested. This can be exampled through *google searc*h and *YouTube.*
<br />
<br />
**- Object Identification**
<br />Object identification systems use machine learning as a means of understanding. Often referred to as "computer vision" best known for being used for facial recognition, self-driving cars, airport security systems (to detect objects of threat in luggage).
<br />
<br />
**- Goal Achievement**
<br />Generating feedback from the systems own experiences and actions, it uses a system of rewards and penalties to figure out problems and solutions.

## Future of AI technology???
While AI/machine learning might be quite advanced, they currently hold no potential for comment sense. As Minsky says, there is no way for a computer to understand the potential of a bit of string "For example, you can pull something with a string, but. you cannot push anything." Another issue is creating data structures, It's no good a system to learn data when there is no method of storage or organisation arranged.

One of the most advanced existing humanoid robot (a robot that has a general appearance based on one human body)is ASIMO; representing two decades of humanoid robotics research by Honda engineers. According to Honda, Asimo's main features are it's lightweight and compact size, advanced & flexible walking and running
technology, expansive range of arm movement, simplified operation and its people-friendly design

## Why reseearch AI
I grew up consuming media that had convinced me of a glorious advancement in AI during my lifetime. Yet, we are still so far from the possibilities of WALL-E's reality becoming ours. I was intrigued to research predictions in advancements in AI, to see if there were anything that could be prepared for. To an extent I felt it nesacarry to keep myself updated with advancments within AI through creative computing as a means of paying homage to my younger self and her vision of an automated future.

## Suggested realities 
Through an age of media and film, as a kid I felt it was easy to get lost in predictions for the future, whether it be the near future or far. I would dream of unrealistic utopias inspired by films such as meet the Robinsons then as I got older, the matrix and blade runner.<br />
